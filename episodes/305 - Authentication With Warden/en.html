<p><a href="https://github.com/hassox/warden">Warden</a> is a Ruby gem that allows you to perform authentication through Rack  Middleware. When you&rsquo;re writing an application&rsquo;s authentication from scratch it&rsquo;s normal to do this entirely within the application but there are several advantages to using Warden. If we use it we can access the authentication through other Rack apps such as mountable engines and we can access authentication outside the application&rsquo;s controllers for example in the routes file to create routing constraints. We&rsquo;ll show you how to do this at the end of the episode but before we do we&rsquo;ll show you what&rsquo;s involved in adding Warden to a Rails application.</p>

<h3>Our Application&rsquo;s Existing Authentication</h3>

<p>The application we&rsquo;ll be working with is shown below. We already have some authentication set up in it with a sign-up page for creating a new user and a login page where users who have registered can sign up.</p>
 
<div class="imageWrapper">

</div>

<p>This authentication is handled within the Rails application. Before we start moving it over to Warden let&rsquo;s take a look at what we&rsquo;ve got so far, starting with the <code>User</code> model. This model is fairly simple; the key line in it is <code>has_secure_password</code>. This method is new in Rails 3.1 and it hashes a password into a <code>password_digest</code> field. We covered this in more detail back in <a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/270-authentication-in-rails-3-1">episode 270</a>.</p>

```/app/models/user.rb
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  attr_accessible :email, :password, :password_confirmation
  validates_presence_of :password, on: :create
  validates_presence_of :email
  has_secure_password
end
```

<p>Most of the authentication logic takes place in the <code>SessionsController</code>&rsquo;s <code>create</code> action.</p> 

``` /app/controllers/sessions_controller.rb
def create
  user = User.find_by_email(params[:email])
  if user && user.authenticate(params[:password])
    session[:user_id] = user.id
    redirect_to root_url, notice: "Logged in!"
  else
    flash.now.alert = "Invalid email or password"
    render "new"
  end
end

def destroy
  session[:user_id] = nil
  redirect_to root_url, notice: "Logged out!"
end
```

<p>In this action we try to find a user by their email address. If we find one we call <code>authenticate</code> on the password the user supplied which will check that it matches the encrypted password in the database. If it does we set the <code>user_id</code> session variable to that user&rsquo;s <code>id</code> and redirect back to the home page. If the user isn&rsquo;t found or the password entered is incorrect we&rsquo;ll show an error message and render the form again.</p>

<p>When a user logs out the destroy action is called. Here we clear the <code>user_id</code> session variable and redirect to the home page with a message telling the user that they have logged out.</p>

<h3>Using Warden For Authentication</h3>

<p>There&rsquo;s more information on the way we&rsquo;ve implemented the authentication in this application see <a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/250-authentication-from-scratch">episode 250</a>. Next, let&rsquo;s see what we need to do to move it into Warden.</p>

<p>Most of the documentation for Warden can be found on its <a href="https://github.com/hassox/warden/wiki">wiki page</a>. A good place to start is the <a href="https://github.com/hassox/warden/wiki/Setup">setup page</a> which shows us how to add Warden as Rack Middleware and this is what we&rsquo;ll do first. We&rsquo;ll need to add the warden gem to the gemfile and run <code>bundle</code> to install it. There is a <code>rails_warden</code> gem which makes using Warden with Rails a little easier but we won&rsquo;t use it here as we&rsquo;ll get a better idea how Warden works by using it directly.</p>

``` /Gemfile
source 'http://rubygems.org'

gem 'rails', '3.1.3'

# Bundle edge Rails instead:
# gem 'rails',     :git => 'git://github.com/rails/rails.git'

gem 'sqlite3'


# Gems used only for assets and not required
# in production environments by default.
group :assets do
  gem 'sass-rails',   '~> 3.1.5'
  gem 'coffee-rails', '~> 3.1.1'
  gem 'uglifier', '>= 1.0.3'
end

gem 'jquery-rails'

# To use ActiveModel has_secure_password
gem 'bcrypt-ruby', '~> 3.0.0'
gem 'warden'
```

<p>We can now add Warden as Rack Middleware through an initializer.</p> 

``` /config/initializers/warden.rb
Rails.application.config.middleware.use Warden::Manager do |manager|
  manager.default_strategies :password
end

Warden::Manager.serialize_into_session do |user|
  user.id
end

Warden::Manager.serialize_from_session do |id|
  User.find(id)
end
```

<p>This code adds <code>Warden::Manager</code> to our application&rsquo;s Middleware. We need to define a default strategy in this code&rsquo;s block and we&rsquo;re going to use one called <code>password</code>. Warden doesn&rsquo;t come with a built-in password strategy so it&rsquo;s up to us to write it. We can call it anything we like, the name password is entirely arbitrary, and we&rsquo;ll write this strategy shortly.</p>

<p>The rest of the code in this file tells Warden how to store the currently logged-in user in the session, which we do by storing their <code>id</code>, and how to fetch the current user from the <code>id</code> in the session.</p>

<p>We still need to write our password strategy and we&rsquo;ll do that now. We do this by calling <code>Warden::Strategies.add</code>, passing it the name of our strategy and a block. We need to define an <code>authenticate!</code> method in this block which should authenticate the user based on the user request parameters, just like we do in the <code>SessionsController</code>. The code we&rsquo;ll need in this method is very similar to the code in the <code>create</code> action so we can copy it into <code>authenticate!</code> and modify it a little.</p>

``` /config/initializers/warden.rb
Warden::Strategies.add(:password) do
  def authenticate!
    user = User.find_by_email(params['email'])
    if user && user.authenticate(params['password'])
      success! user
    else
      fail "Invalid email or password"
    end
  end
end
```

<p>As we&rsquo;re in a Rack application we need to use strings instead of symbols when we fetch the <code>email</code> and <code>password</code> parameters. If the authentication succeeds we call a <code>success!</code> method and pass in the user.  If it fails we call <code>fail</code>, passing in a message explaining why.</p>

<p>We can change the <code>SessionsController</code> now so that it uses Warden for authentication.</p>

``` /app/controllers/sessions_controller.rb
def create
  user = env['warden'].authenticate
  if user
    redirect_to root_url, notice: "Logged in!"
  else
    flash.now.alert = env['warden'].message
    render "new"
  end
end

def destroy
  env['warden'].logout
  redirect_to root_url, notice: "Logged out!"
end
```

<p>We can access Warden at any time through the Rack environment by <code>calling env[&#x27;warden&#x27;]</code>. In the <code>create</code> action we now use the <code>authenticate</code> method to authenticate the user against the parameters from the login form. This method will return a <code>User</code> object if a matching user is found or <code>nil</code> otherwise. If the authentication fails we can call <code>env[&#x27;warden&#x27;].message</code> to fetch the message that was passed to <code>fail</code>.</p>

<p>We can test this out now. As we&rsquo;ve modified an initializer we&rsquo;ll need to restart the Rails server if it&rsquo;s already running but once we have we can visit the login page and try out our form. If we enter an invalid email address or password we&rsquo;ll see an error message, but when we enter the correct login information we&rsquo;re logged in so our authentication appears to be working.</p>

<div class="imageWrapper">
  <img src="http://asciicasts.com/system/photos/883/original/E305I02.png" width="800" height="399" alt="Logging in through Warden seems to work."/>
</div>

<p>There is a problem, though. We&rsquo;re logged in now, but our application no longer shows the email address of the currently-logged in user as it&rsquo;s no longer detecting that user correctly. The code that fetches the current user is in a <code>current_user</code> method  in the <code>ApplicationController</code> and it finds the current user based on the id stored in the <code>user_id</code> session variable. We should instead now fetch the user from Warden by calling <code>env[&#x27;warden&#x27;].user</code>.</p> 

<p>We&rsquo;re already calling <code>env[&#x27;warden&#x27;]</code> a lot in our application&rsquo;s controllers. It would be more convenient if we had a warden method we could use instead so we&rsquo;ll write one in the <code>ApplicationController</code> now and use it to return the current user in <code>current_user</code>.</p>

``` /app/controllers/application_controller.rb
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  protect_from_forgery

private

  def current_user
    warden.user
  end
  helper_method :current_user
  
  def warden
    env['warden']
  end
end
```

<p>When we reload our home page now we&rsquo;ll be reported as logged in.</p>

<div class="imageWrapper">
  <img src="http://asciicasts.com/system/photos/884/original/E305I03.png" width="800" height="352" alt="The name of the logged-in user is now displayed correctly."/>
</div>

<p>There&rsquo;s one more place where we&rsquo;re still using the &lsquo;old&rsquo; authentication, in the <code>UsersController</code>&rsquo;s <code>create</code> action where the user is signed up. When a user registers its a good idea to log them in and we do so by setting the <code>user_id</code> session variable to the <code>id</code> of the newly created user. This, of course, won&rsquo;t work any more. We need to call Warden&rsquo;s <code>set_user</code> method instead.</p>

``` /app/controllers/users_controller.rb
def create
  @user = User.new(params[:user])
  if @user.save
    warden.set_user(@user)
    redirect_to root_url, notice: "Signed up!"
  else
    render "new"
  end
end
```

<h3>Adding a Failure Application</h3>

<p>Our app is now using Warden for all of its authentication and it was fairly easy to add. There are still a few things we can do to improve it, though. One good thing to add is called a Failure App. We do this inside the <code>Warden::Manager</code> Middleware block.</p>

``` /config/initializers/warden.rb
Rails.application.config.middleware.use Warden::Manager do |manager|
  manager.default_strategies :password
  manager.failure_app = SessionsController.action(:new)
end
```

<p>We can set <code>manager.failure_app</code> to any Rack application and it will be triggered whenever authentication fails. In Rails 3 any action in a controller can act as a Rack app so we&rsquo;ve set this to call the <code>SessionController</code>&rsquo;s <code>new</code> action as this is where we want the application to render the login form when authentication fails.</p> 

<p>There&rsquo;s a potential here, however. In development mode this action will be cached and won&rsquo;t reload automatically. For this reason it&rsquo;s better to call the action through a lambda, like this.</p>

``` /config/initializers/warden.rb
Rails.application.config.middleware.use Warden::Manager do |manager|
  manager.default_strategies :password
  manager.failure_app = lambda { |env| SessionsController.action(:new).call(env) }
end
```

<p>Now the action will only be called dynamically and the form will reload dynamically in development.</p>

<p>We can take advantage of this new approach in the <code>SessionsController</code>. In <code>create</code> we call <code>authenticate</code> which will return <code>nil</code> if no matching user. If we call  <code>authenticate!</code> (with a exclamation mark) the failure application will be triggered whenever authentication fails. This means that we can simplify the action&rsquo;s code.</p>

``` /app/controllers/sessions_controller.rb
def new
  flash.now.alert = warden.message if warden.message.present?
end

def create
  warden.authenticate!
  redirect_to root_url, notice: "Logged in!"
end
```

<p>The <code>create</code> action can now redirect immediately after calling <code>authenticate!</code> as if this fails the failure app is called which will call <code>new</code> and show the login form again. We&rsquo;ll have to move the flash message to <code>new</code> and add a check to it so that it only shows if the Warden message is present.</p>

<p>We can try this out now, after restarting our Rails server if need be. If we visit the login page and enter an invalid password we&rsquo;ll see the error message from the <code>fail</code> method.</p>

<div class="imageWrapper">
  <img src="http://asciicasts.com/system/photos/885/original/E305I04.png" width="800" height="419" alt="Our failure application is now triggered if our login details are incorrect."/>
</div>

<p>When we enter the correct password we&rsquo;ll be logged in successfully.</p>

<p>The advantage of this is that no matter where we call the authentication the failure app will be called if authentication fails and our application will behave as we expect it to.</p>

<p>Another good practice is to add a <code>valid?</code> method to the Warden Strategies we create. This method should return a boolean value depending on whether the strategy should try to authenticate. For our strategy this should only happen when both the <code>email</code> and <code>password</code> parameters are present.</p>

``` /config/initializers/sessions_controller.rb
Warden::Strategies.add(:password) do
  def valid?
    params['email'] && params['password']
  end
  
  def authenticate!
    user = User.find_by_email(params['email'])
    if user && user.authenticate(params['password'])
      success! user
    else
      fail "Invalid email or password"
    end
  end
end
```

<p>The benefit of <code>valid?</code> is more apparent when we have multiple strategies in an application. If we had, say, an <code>api_key</code> strategy alongside our <code>password</code> strategy then when <code>authenticate</code> is called the password strategy&rsquo;s <code>valid?</code> method will be checked first to see if it&rsquo;s valid. If it is then its <code>authenticate!</code> method is called. If it isn&rsquo;t valid or if its authentication fails the <code>api_key</code> strategy will be called. We could have many different strategies in our application, say HTTP basic or an OmniAuth strategy and having a <code>valid?</code> method for each one will make sure that the correct one is used.</p>

<p>If you want to see examples of different Warden strategies it&rsquo;s worth looking at the source code for <a href="https://github.com/plataformatec/devise">Devise</a>. Devise uses Warden internally and has several different strategies. One that&rsquo;s particularly interesting is <a href="https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/blob/master/lib/devise/strategies/rememberable.rb">Rememberable</a> which handles &ldquo;Remember Me&rdquo; functionality. This strategy uses cookies and if you need to do this you should look at the <a href="https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/blob/master/lib/devise/rails/warden_compat.rb">Warden compatibility file</a> as this shows how to define a <code>cookies</code> method by using <code>ActionDispatch::Request</code> to make a <code>request</code> object.</p>

<h3>Using Authentication Outside a Controller</h3>

<p>Now that we have Warden set up in our application we&rsquo;ll show you how it can be used outside a Rails controller by adding a constraint to the routes file. We have <code>signup</code> and <code>login</code> routes and for the purposes of this example we&rsquo;ll make these routes unavailable when the user is logged in.</p>

``` /config/routes.rb
Auth::Application.routes.draw do
  scope constraints: lambda { |r| r.env['warden'].user.nil?} do
    get "signup", to: "users#new", as: "signup"
    get "login", to: "sessions#new", as: "login"
  end
  get "logout", to: "sessions#destroy", as: "logout"
  root to: "home#index"
  resources :users
  resources :sessions
end
```

<p>We add the constraints as a scope and fetch the environment <code>warden</code> object inside a  lambda block to check if there&rsquo;s a current user. We&rsquo;ll only allow access to the <code>signup</code> and <code>login</code> routes if there isn&rsquo;t one.</p> 

<p>If we login to our application now and visit the <code>signup</code> page we&rsquo;ll see a routing error.</p> 

<div class="imageWrapper">
  <img src="http://asciicasts.com/system/photos/886/original/E305I05.png" width="800" height="280" alt="The route no longer matches."/>
</div>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t something we&rsquo;d do in a real application as it provides a poor user experience but it works an an example of how we can use authentication outside a Rails controller. It&rsquo;s generally better to add behaviour like this through a controller&rsquo;s <code>before_filter</code>. If there are multiple routes pointing to the same action then we may still be able to access the page through one of these.</p>
